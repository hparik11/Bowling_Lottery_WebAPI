# Web API for Bowling Lottery- Next Capital


The app will be a simple way for a bowling league to track a progressive jackpot. Bowlers in the league can buy tickets to enter the drawing. All tickets cost $10 dollars, and the proceeds go into the jackpot. After some tickets are bought, one ticket is drawn at random. The owner of that ticket gets to roll once. If they get a strike, they win the entire pot. Otherwise, they win a fraction of the pot, and the remaining pot rolls over into the next drawing.This API provides the backend for this app.
